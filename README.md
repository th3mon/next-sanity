# Next + Sanity App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) deployed on Vercel:

- [next-sanity-wine.vercel.app](https://next-sanity-wine.vercel.app/)

Project is built upon on tutorial [Create a Personal Website with Next.js 13, Sanity.io, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript
]. You can go straight to the video on YouTube -> [Personal Website Tutorial with Next.js 13, Sanity.io, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript](https://youtu.be/OcTPaUfay5I)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## API
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
